This is a placeholder for the *** add-on that is currently being beta tested.  If you would like to beta test, you can sign up to be an <a href="https://www.ankingmed.com/vip" rel="nofollow">AnKing VIP</a>.

<b>Why is this add-on only available to <a href="https://www.ankingmed.com/vip" rel="nofollow">AnKing VIPs?</a></b>
This add-on was paid for using money that is earned on our AnKing Membership. We create add-ons using this income, release them for Members only first, and eventually release them to the public. Creating and maintaining add-ons is very time-intensive and expensive, so we have to fund this somehow. We employ some fantastic software engineers in the community to help us create tools that are useful to everyone. If you have ideas for new add-ons that would be useful or fun, please feel free to let us know!

<b>What other add-ons and perks are available to AnKing VIPs?</b>
We have made a running list of all current beta add-ons on <a href="https://www.ankingmed.com/vip-addons" rel="nofollow">this website</a>.  Other perks of being a member include individualized help with Anki, early release YouTube videos, live Q&amp;As, etc. These are listed under the tiers on the <a href="https://www.ankingmed.com/vip" rel="nofollow">VIP Sign-up page.</a>

<b>Why are we putting it on AnkiWeb early?</b>
Because we plan to release these add-ons to the public eventually, we create an add-on listing in order to get an add-on code. This makes it so that the add-on our VIPs download will continue to get updated once it is released to the public (vs needing to delete the early release add-on and redownload the public one)
<b>What other add-ons have we funded?</b>
Other add-ons we've released and/or are currently maintaining using income from this project include: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1625103157">Advanced Card Styles</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/952691989">AnKing Note Types (Easy Customization)</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1435775540">Browser Resizer</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1739176371">Clickable Tags</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1210908941">Custom Background Image and Gear Icon</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/960563361">Export Single Tag for Sharing</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/46611790">Fastbar</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/511710206">Field Autocomplete</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/688199788">ReColor</a>, <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1102281552">Special Fields</a>, and more!
