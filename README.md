## Calculate New Cards To Do
Adds a config to set goals that will automatically update daily and tell you how many new cards need to be completed per day or per week. These goals can be displayed on the Anki main window.

## Weekends & Holidays
Reschedule weekend or holiday reviews to the rest of the week! Choose which days you want off and which cards to reschedule (i.e. only move mature cards and keep your streak!). Works with Anki Mobile by rescheduling on sync.

## Exam Notifier
This add-on will notify you if you are reviewing a card that will be rescheduled past your exam date! Use this to reschedule your cards so you can see them one last time before the big test!
